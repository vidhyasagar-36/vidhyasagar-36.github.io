                        As a kid I was very much interested in understanding the working of robots and had built some small project during
                        my school days. These led me to take Mechatronics engineering as my Bachelor degree. The first year wasn't that great
                        as I used to travel for 3 hours a day. Later in my second year i shiffted close to college which made life much easier.
                        Now im in my 3rd year attending classes online, which i feel is kind of good for me. I got more time to learn new stuff 
                        other than course subject and i also improved my gaming skills along with that.

                        My college days wasnt really that great cause all I did was study all day of the week.
                        I was preparing for JEE exams too. The college was pretty close to my house so travelling 
                        was never a problem. I had changed my college during 2ND PU. Believe me the process is nerve wreaking.

                        Lady Wellington school, the name Lady means that the institution is run by women. I studied for 13 years 
                        in this school i.e from nursery to 10th std. I had some really good experience during this time. I gotta say 
                        the teacher in the schools during my time were the best.
